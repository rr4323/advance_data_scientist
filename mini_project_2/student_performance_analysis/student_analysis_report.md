# Student Performance Analysis Report

## Overview
This report presents a comprehensive analysis of student performance based on various assessment components including Mini Tests, Live Tests, and Assignments, along with attendance data. The analysis includes statistical measures, performance categorization, and visual representations of the data.

## Assessment Components
The assessment structure consists of the following components:
- Mini Test 1 (20% of total marks)
- Mini Test 2 (20% of total marks)
- Live Test (40% of total marks)
- Assignment (20% of total marks)

## Performance Categories
Students are classified into the following performance categories:
- Excellent: ≥ 85%
- Good: ≥ 71%
- Average: ≥ 50%
- Needs Improvement: < 50%
